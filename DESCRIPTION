      given = "Ian", family = "Lyttle",

Description: Serialzing lists into text-lists can make it easier to work with 
    web-service APIs. This package can help you work with query-parameter data 
    in the "R world", helping you serialize it for use in the "remote world".
    In many cases,
    parameters for http queries are formatted differently from R: logicals are
    expressed as true/false, time durations are specified in ms (R uses
    difftime, or lubridate durations),
    and vectors are expressed using comma-delimited strings. The goal of this
    package is to make that translation process easier.
