Title: Help to Compose http Queries
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: c(
    person(
      given = "Ian", family = "Lyttle", 
      email = "ian.lyttle@schneider-electric.com",

Description: One purpose of an API client in R is to let you work in the 
  R world and for the client translate to the remote world. In many cases,
  parameters for http queries are formatted differently from R: logicals are
  expressed as true/false, time durations are specified in ms (R uses 
  difftime, or lubridate durations), 
  and vectors are expressed using comma-delimited strings. The goal of this
  package is to make that translation process easier.
