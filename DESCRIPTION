Title: Help to Format http Queries

      given = "Ian", family = "Lyttle", 
      email = "ian.lyttle@schneider-electric.com",

Description: One purpose of an API client in R is to let you work in the
    R world and for the client translate to the remote world. In many cases,
    parameters for http queries are formatted differently from R: logicals are
    expressed as true/false, time durations are specified in ms (R uses
    difftime, or lubridate durations),
    and vectors are expressed using comma-delimited strings. The goal of this
    package is to make that translation process easier.
