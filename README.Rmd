# srlst

One purpose of an API client in R is to let you work in the R world and for the client translate to the remote world. In many cases, parameters for http queries are formatted differently from R: 

  - logicals are expressed: `"true"`/`"false"` 
  - time durations are specified in ms (R uses difftime, or **lubridate** durations or periods)
  - vectors are expressed using delimited strings (usually delimited by commas). 
  
The goal of this package is to make that translation process easier.

## Installation

You can install srlst from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/srlst")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library("lubridate")
library("srlst")

query_params <- list(
  delay = dseconds(3),
  print = TRUE,
  next_steps = c("collate", "send"),
  number = 20
)

srlst(query_params)
```

Here's where it can be handy:

```{r httr}
library("httr")

url <- parse_url("https://useful.site.com/service")

url$query <- srlst(query_params)

build_url(url)
```
